In 1608, aged 17, Cranborne's father sent him to France, but quickly recalled him to England to marry Catherine, the daughter of Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk in December 1608. His father was determined that Cranborne should spend two years living abroad, and instructed him to return to France following his marriage.

In 1937, Sandor Salgo and a string quartet would serenade the bed-ridden wife of the American Ambassador to Hungary. America's walls were closed to immigrants, but the Ambassador refused to leave Mr. Salgo behind and he was afforded a special visa to America in 1937. While Salgo returned to Europe later in his life, he refused ever to visit Hungary or even speak Hungarian, because of the repressive government during his youth, the anti-Semitism, and in the Nazi years, the holocaust. In 1939 (with no formal training in English) Sandor Salgo taught at the Westminster Choir College in Princeton, New Jersey. It was during this time at Princeton that Albert Einstein attended one of Mr. Salgo's concerts. He sent him a letter of appreciation saying, ``Mr. Sandor Salgo is a musician of high standing. The concert he gave ... has made a deep impression on me,'' the two played occasionally in a quartet together. Sandor Salgo was asked to conduct the Israeli symphony but politely declined saying, ``I came here to be an American.'' From 1949-1973 Sandor Salgo taught and conducted the music and opera programs at Stanford University. Sandor and Priscilla Salgo began directing the Carmel Bach festival in 1956 and turned it into an internationally acclaimed festival.

She would tell her students, ``You have a perfect right to branch out, if you have the stuff in you, if you discover your own richness, if you have something to say.'' Holm's philosophy of teaching was how to find the essence of dance and understand where the movement comes from in the body that way it is a natural response in the dancer's body. She brought weltanschauung to her dance teaching. Holm was strict; she expected greatness from her students which would come from a willingness to work hard. It was her thought that if you worked hard and truly wanted it, you would achieve the desired outcome. Holm had an extremely keen eye, she had the ability to look at something and verbalize what she wanted using elaborate imagery and analogies. She used her technique class as a preparation for her improvisation and composition classes. These classes were where the students could expand and experiment on the skills that were presented in class, making the movement innate in their bodies. A large amount of Holm's choreography came from the improv and comp classes. Hanya Holm taught anatomy, Dalcroze eurhythmics, improvisation, and Labanotation at her school. She taught at Colorado College, Mills College, University of Wisconsin, Alwin Nikolais School, and was the Head of Dance Department in New York's Musical Theatre Academy. After 1974, she taught at the Juilliard School (Martha Hill, director) in New York.

They provided artwork that was realistic of the Native American lifestyle in contrast to the work of Anglo-Americans romantic depictions. Traditional design elements were formalized at the Santa Fe Indian School, defining authentic Native American art. Juanita Suazo Dubray, a lifelong resident of Taos Pueblo, is a Native American potter. In 1980, at the age of 50, Dubray began making micaceous pottery, upholding the tradition of her mother and their ancestors. Dubray added an element of sculptural relief with icons of corn, turtles, lizards, and kiva steps in relief; Her original corn design her most recognized symbol.

They initiated an important segment of what would become for the global book industry a highly popular, multicultural spirituality and philosophy genre. They also foreshadowed a trend toward multi-media usage in an emergent, classy, holistic marketplace. Gia-Fu became involved in the East-West philosophy and spirituality movement that occurred in Northern California, centered by the evolution of the AAAS, reformed as the California Institute of Integral Studies. This was part of a core sociocultural transformation that became known as the San Francisco Renaissance. Regarding that, Alan Watts stated, ``I know what it is, but when you ask me, I don't. I am too close to what has happened to see it in proper perspective. I know only that between, say, 1958 and 1970 a huge tide of spiritual energy in the form of poetry, music, philosophy, painting, religion, communications techniques in radio, television, and cinema, dancing, theater, and general life-style swept out of this city and its environs to affect America and the whole world.'' Michael Murphy, a primary founder of Esalen Institute, was also a student at the AAAS during his Stanford student days. From this network, including the community of the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in San Francisco, the seeds of Esalen were planted. Gia-Fu was drawn to Esalen by his close friend Dick Price. At Esalen, Gia-Fu served as accountant, ``Keeper of the Baths'' and Crazy Taoist, a few stories of which can be found in the entertaining and informative history of Esalen and birth of the human potential movement, The Upstart Spring."}], "judgments": [{"rater": "1264223381988340244", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "1666978224370465111", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "12086754839319333463", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "6736745672381419418", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "3149241296119765999", "judgment": "no"}]}

This novel caused dismay from the reactionary segment of society and loud applause from the critics and is considered a revolutionary departure from the traditional treatment of the feminine role in marriage. ``Breakthrough'' is a novel that ends with the heroine awareness that she didn't really need to depend upon a man in order to lead a fulfilling life. The book enjoyed an unexpected publishing success and went through five consecutive editions. Mercedes Valdivieso had the extreme audacity to become an innovator; she bridged the gap between romantic and domestic fiction in a society where women have been viewed as a sexless gender, icons of virtue, and depending on men to meet the necessities of life. Valdivieso also was founder and director of ``Adan'' a Men's Magazine, she published articles in newspapers and magazines and she gave many lectures and speeches.

He later taught a course in the history of science at Harvard from 1948 until 1956 at the suggestion of university president James Conant. After leaving Harvard, Kuhn taught at the University of California, Berkeley, in both the philosophy department and the history department, being named Professor of the History of Science in 1961. At Berkeley, he wrote and published (in 1962) his best known and most influential work: The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. In 1964, he joined Princeton University as the M.

She was born in Baltimore, Maryland the daughter of an elementary school teacher, who later became a curriculum specialist, and a bus driver who was among the first Black men to integrate the Baltimore Transit Company. When she was a month old, her parents divorced and she and her mother lived with her grandparents. Her mother later remarried and she had a turbulent upbringing, but it was her grandmother's steadfast commitment to community that profoundly influenced her sense of social justice. While attending Milford Mill Senior High school now Milford Mill Academy in Baltimore, she notes humorously that she played Mrs. Chumley in a production of Harvey, the wife to Dr. Chumley played by the now celebrity Ira Glass, of ``This American Life''. She is a single mother, with a son and a daughter born in 1983 and 1985 respectively. Muntu has organized extensively in Baltimore, North Carolina, Savannah - and Atlanta, Georgia where ``she grew her political and feminist wings'' around issues ranging from gender equality to the death penalty. Muntu has read her poetry at the National Black Arts Festival in Atlanta with such notables as Sonia Sanchez and Mari Evans. She was diagnosed with Lymphoma Cancer in 1994 and considers herself a survivor. In 1996, after hearing her read her poetry, author and American Book Award winner Dr. Joyce Ann Joyce suggested her for inclusion in the prestigious anthology . One of the featured poems ``Of Women and Spirit'' is an homage to African-American film-maker Julie Dash's ``Daughters of the Dust''. The editors hailed Muntu as a ``rising star in neo-aesthetic literary circles''. Spurred by her dedication to women's equality, she was one of the principal writers (among them Ajamu Baraka who won the United Nations Ambassador Kofi Annan award as a death penalty activism) of a paper entitled ``A Call to End the Oppression of Women...'' a position paper confronting the sexist undertones of the Million Man march published in Fertile Ground by Kalamu Ya Salaam and Keshia Brown (Renagade Press). Muntu has said that one of the highlights of her life was having New Years dinner with the famed historian Dr. John Henrik Clarke at the home of Larry ``Obadele Williams''. In 2007 Muntu relocated to London, United Kingdom where she founded Right Limb Films, a progressive production company."}], "judgments": [{"rater": "13263558342802011415", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "6570687721363324718", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "1666978224370465111", "judgment": "yes"}, {"rater": "3149241296119765999", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "12022408018620867151", "judgment": "no"}]}

He engaged five musicians: oboist Marcel Tabuteau, flutist Georges Barr\u00e8re, bassoonist Auguste Mesnard, and clarinetist Leon Leroy from France, and trumpeter Adolphe Dubois from Belgium. Damrosch was fined by the musician's union for not advertising for musicians from New York, but the emigrating musicians were allowed to stay. In addition to achieving the intended effect of improving the quality of the New York Symphony Orchestra, Damrosch brought the United States five extremely fine musicians. Tabuteau (q.v.) was particularly influential. He served as principal oboist of the Philadelphia Orchestra from 1915 to 1954 under Leopold Stokowski and, just as importantly, taught in Philadelphia at the Curtis Institute of Music. Laila Storch wrote, ``During the thirty years during which Tabuteau taught at the Curtis Institute of Music, he came to exercise a decisive influence on the standards of oboe playing in the whole United States, as well as raising the level of woodwind achievement in general. Nor was the impact of his teaching confined to winds alone, as the many string players and pianists who attended his classes will testify.'' Barr\u00e8re was well known as conductor of his own ensembles and as an influential teacher as well as for being the long-time principal flute player (1905--1928) in the New York Symphony Orchestra. Although perhaps less known, the other three Damrosch imports were important additions to the pool of New York musicians. Mesnard (from 1913--1928) and Leroy (from 1911--1914) were principal players in the New York Philharmonic after leaving the New York Symphony Orchestra. Nathaniel Shilkret's payrolls show Mesnard played in Shilkret's orchestras for more than thirty radio broadcasts."}], "judgments": [{"rater": "1666978224370465111", "judgment": "yes"}, {"rater": "13263558342802011415", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "11495735324295360935", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "12086754839319333463", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "3149241296119765999", "judgment": "no"}]}

Wentworth graduated from Harvard College in 1715. He became a merchant at Portsmouth, and frequently represented the town in the provincial assembly. He was appointed a king's councillor, October 12, 1734. When in 1741 New Hampshire was made a distinct province, Wentworth became its governor on December 13 of that year. Wentworth was authorized by the crown to grant patents of unoccupied land, and in 1749 began making grants in what is now southern Vermont, enriching himself by a clever scheme of selling land to developers in spite of jurisdictional claims for this region by the Province of New York. He often named the new townships after famous contemporaries in order to gain support for his enterprises (e.g. Rutland after John Manners, 3rd Duke of Rutland; Bennington he named after himself). In each of the grants, he stipulated for the reservation of a lot for an Episcopal church. Ultimately, this scheme led to a great deal of contention between New York, New England, and the settlers in Vermont. The dispute long outlived Wentworth's administration, lasting until Vermont was admitted as a state in 1791. Fort Wentworth built in 1755 at Northumberland, New Hampshire was built by his order and named after him. Wentworth also gave important government positions to relatives and gave them extensive grants of land. Growing annoyance with his administration's corruption, taxes, and mismanagement and neglect of the crown's timber interests, forced his resignation in 1767. After his resignation as governor, he gave Dartmouth College 500 acres of land on which the college buildings were erected. His nephew John Wentworth succeeded him as governor."}], "judgments": [{"rater": "1264223381988340244", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "6905422328658452998", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "6968726908160095830", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "12022408018620867151", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "12086754839319333463", "judgment": "no"}]}

Originally known as the Kennelly-- Heaviside layer, this region of the Earth's atmosphere became known as the Ionosphere. In 1912 Eccles suggested that solar radiation was responsible for the observed differences in radio wave propagation during the day and night. He carried out experiments into atmospheric disturbances of radio waves and used wave detectors and amplifiers in his work.

She has been called, by some, the Cuban Julia Child for her ability to communicate culinary arts to a popular audience. Born in New York to Cuban immigrants, she moved with her family to their native Cuba at the age of 9. She was quite skilled at tossing salad, winning a local competition as a teenager. She studied nutrition at the University of London during the early 1940s, and later said that this experience gave her insight into preparing food under wartime conditions. By the 1950s, Villapol was famous in Cuba for her standard cookbooks on Cuban cuisine, Cocina criolla (1954) and Cocina al minuto (1958). Both books were reprinted without her permission in the United States after the revolution and remain in print today. From 1951 to 1997 she had her own cooking show on Cuban television, one of the longest-running shows in television history. After 1959, she sided with the revolution and remained a fixture in Cuban popular culture throughout her life. During Cuba's ``Special Period'' of the early 1990s, she managed to demonstrate on her show how to prepare traditional Cuban recipes under the difficult circumstances of rationing, poverty and shortages. Though she came from a wealthy background, her father identified himself as a communist, and gave her a Russian first name in tribute to the Russian revolution (Santiago, 1998); following in his footsteps, Villapol found an accommodation with Cuban communism and succeeded in winning over her audience by cooking within the real limitations of actually existing socialism (Miller, 1996)."}], "judgments": [{"rater": "1264223381988340244", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "3149241296119765999", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "10865367442061928261", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "5346153820624061638", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "18153321702395861849", "judgment": "no"}]}

Henry Bourne Joy, a member of one of Detroit's oldest and wealthiest families, bought a Packard. Impressed by its reliability, he visited the Packards and soon enlisted a group of investors--including Truman Handy Newberry and Russell A. Alger Jr. On October 2, 1902, this group refinanced and renamed the New York and Ohio Automobile Company as ``Packard Motor Car Company'', with James as president. Alger later served as vice-president. Packard moved its automobile operation to Detroit soon after, and Joy became general manager, later to be chairman of the board. An original Packard, reputedly the first manufactured, was donated by a grateful James Packard to his alma mater, Lehigh University, and is preserved there in the Packard Laboratory. Another is on display at the Packard Museum in Warren, Ohio."}], "judgments": [{"rater": "652625289254394043", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "6570687721363324718", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "10906565243326693454", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "6968726908160095830", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "12086754839319333463", "judgment": "no"}]}

The writing staff were, at least initially, divided with respect to Mirkin's leadership (which Forrester described as ``a little bit dictatorial'') and style of humor. This division caused the show to move away from more ``realistic'' emotional and character-based stories to ``pure comedy'' and ``surreal'' humor, epitomized by episodes like ``Deep Space Homer''. A. O. Scott notes that ``several veterans recall the 'crazy David Mirkin years' as a time of wild inventiveness.'' Mirkin conducted the show's writing sessions in one room, rather than splitting the writers into two groups, as other showrunners had done, and often worked late into the night. Some praised Mirkin's leadership and comedic style, including Appel, who felt that ``the shows were great under him.'' Others criticised him. Kushell challenged Mirkin over the episode ``A Star is Burns'', a crossover with The Critic. Most of the writers opposed producing it, but it was supported by Brooks, with whom Mirkin agreed. Kushell's opposition went unheeded, and Mirkin insulted him in front of the other writers; Kushell's contract was not renewed. In a 2004 interview with Animation Magazine, Mirkin stated that he ``really wasn't at all intimidated to join show's writing crew,'' because he ``had worked with and written with'' many of his fellow writers previously. Mirkin said, ``took this show in a direction that is more personal to me. I did that, had a great time doing that, and everyone was very receptive to that.'' He felt that he ``brought show back to a more story-oriented'' approach and increased the focus on characters and their emotions, while ``at the same time still keeping it surreal and weird''. During his tenure, Mirkin moved the show's focus toward Homer, and also developed some of the secondary characters, including Apu. He also strongly opposed censorship and network interference, telling post-production supervisor Colin A.B.V. Lewis to ignore the list of changes sent by the Fox censors. He aimed to put ``as much blood and guts'' as possible into the episode ``Treehouse of Horror V'' as an attack on the censors. Mirkin's era and style of humor are popular amongst the show's fans."}], "judgments": [{"rater": "6968726908160095830", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "12086754839319333463", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "1264223381988340244", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "15508466506567648824", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "7379787628707821873", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "6905422328658452998", "judgment": "no"}]}

Wallace's first head coaching stint came in the GSC when he was the head coach at the University of North Alabama from 1988-1997. During his time at UNA, he led the Lions to three consecutive national championships from 1993-1995 as his squads finished with an overall record of 41-1 during the course of those three seasons. The 1995 team was selected as the ``Best Team of the Quarter Century'' in Division II. Wallace also led UNA to Gulf South Conference Championships during the 1993-1995 seasons, while his Lions also qualified for the NCAA Division II Playoffs six times during his tenure. Over his 10 seasons at the helm, he compiled an overall mark of 82-36-1, and he also produced a total of 12 NFL players. Prior to arriving in Livingston, he had served as the head coach at Temple University since 1997. Upon hiring Wallace, many around UWA hoped he could lead the football team back to its glory days. The Wallace Era began with a great glimmer of hope as UWA recorded its first winning season in 14 years. The Tigers finished 6-5 on the season. UWA also ended several streaks picking up wins at Lambuth, against Southern Arkansas, and at Arkansas-Monticello. The excitement was put on hold, however, as the team finished the 2007 season with a 1-9 record and posted a 4-7 record in 2008. allace and his team put together a memorable season in 2009. The season began with three consecutive victories including a televised home win over Arkansas Tech. Unfortunately, three consecutive losses followed. A couple of wins over #22 Delta State and Arkansas-Monticello put UWA right back in the thick of the playoff race, but a loss to West Georgia the following week nearly derailed their hopes. During the season finale, UWA was locked in a battle for their playoff lives against longtime rival and Wallace's former team, North Alabama. At the time, UNA was ranked #1 in all the Division II polls. Through a fearless and courageous effort, UWA sent the game to overtime after losing the lead they held throughout the game. After four overtimes, it appeared UNA was set to claim the victory until a forced fumble gave UWA the ball. From that, they took advantage and kicked the game winning field goal. It was the first win for the Tigers at Braly Municipal Stadium in Florence since the 1987 season. The NCAA rewarded UWA's efforts with a berth in the NCAA Division II playoffs. In the first round, the Tigers upset #20 Albany State 24-22 on the road. After falling behind early against #10 Carson-Newman, the Tigers mounted a rally before falling short 59-41. The Tigers gathered an 8-5 record, the most wins since 1975, and had eight All-GSC honors. UWA posted a 5-1 record at Tiger Stadium, the best since 1985, and tallied the most wins over GSC opponents since 1981 with six. They received their first two rankings in school history at the end of the season. The AFCA placed them #21, while the D2Football.com poll placed them higher two spots at #19."}], "judgments": [{"rater": "10690115145453316046", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "16671464637895630418", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "12086754839319333463", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "10865367442061928261", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "6968726908160095830", "judgment": "no"}]}

One summer, Neil meets and falls in love with Brenda Patimkin, a student at Radcliffe College who is from a wealthy family living in the affluent suburb of Short Hills. The novella explores the level of classism which afflicts the relationship, despite the fact that Brenda's father, Ben, originally came from the same environment as Neil. The issue of assimilation is intrinsic as well, since Brenda is much more assimilated than Neil. The title, Goodbye, Columbus refers to a record Brenda's brother listens to about his years as an athlete at Ohio State University, further proof of the Patimkins' success at assimilation. As the book proceeds, Neil finds that their relationship is falling apart. It is finally realized that Neil and Brenda's relationship is not based on love but lust. Thus, the title may be seen as a metaphor for Neil saying goodbye to the affluent, assimilated world of the Patimkins."}], "judgments": [{"rater": "652625289254394043", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "2791701447620769094", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "6905422328658452998", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "1264223381988340244", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "6063741883945424276", "judgment": "no"}]}

Inspired by hip hop artists like Outkast and A Tribe Called Quest, Harrison wanted to combine the easy retainability of hip hop lyrics with educational content. Harrison graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a degree in English. He then moved to San Francisco, where he met Alex Rappaport, a music graduate of Tufts University. Harrison shared his idea with Rappaport, and in 2004 the two made a demo recording of two songs with a combined total of 80 SAT words. Within two months Sparknotes made the songs available for free streaming, and soon afterward Harrison and Rappaport set up a Flocabulary website. Cider Mill Press published Flocabulary books and distributed them through Sterling Publishing to sell the book at Barnes & Noble and Borders stores. The Hip Hop Approach to SAT Vocabulary sold 10,000 copies in its first year of publication and was reprinted five times. In 2005, Flocabulary went on a promotional tour of concerts at schools. By early 2006, Flocabulary began self-publishing its products. Harrison and Rappaport raised $50,000 from family and friends and began visiting schools and education conferences to sell their products. Flocabulary entered into a contest for startup businesses at Columbia Business School and won a social value award. After participating in a collaborative business advice program with Columbia students, Harrison and Rappaport decided to stop self-publishing and returned to Cider Mill. Flocabulary raised $110,000 from investors and hired 30 sales representatives. In September 2007, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt released a line of Flocabulary products called ``Word Up'' for teaching standardized test vocabulary. Word Up! proved successful and helped to double their annual revenue in 2008 to $600,000. Flocabulary's 2007 release Shakespeare Is Hip-Hop featured musical and lyrical contributions from a number of hip hop artists, including Grammy Award-winner 9th Wonder. In 2008, Harrison and Rappaport created The Week in Rap, a weekly series of songs that has covered current events including the 2008 presidential election and the results of California Proposition 8. By 2009, Flocabulary made $900,000 in annual revenue. Flocabulary products have been used by 300,000 students in 12,000 schools across 100 school districts."}], "judgments": [{"rater": "10690115145453316046", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "13263558342802011415", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "1295059937994543754", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "3149241296119765999", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "12086754839319333463", "judgment": "no"}]}

The founder, Glenn Doman (a physical therapist), together with Carl Delacato (an educational psychologist), developed an approach to treating children with brain injury, published in 1960 in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). Glenn Doman received his degree in Physical Therapy from the University of Pennsylvania in 1940. Their work drew heavily on the ideas of Temple Fay (a neurophysiologist), who was head of the Department of Neurosurgery at Temple University Medical School and president of the Philadelphia Neurological Society. Fay believed that the infant brain evolves (as with evolution of the species) through stages of development similar to a fish, a reptile, a mammal and finally a human. This idea, encapsulated as ``ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny'', also known as the recapitulation theory, is considered obsolete by modern mainstream biologists. The IAHP claim that brain injury at a given level of neurological development prevents further progress. The IAHP states that its therapies are based on the theory of neuroplasticity, or the brain's inherent ability to grow both functionally and anatomically. It claims that traditional medicine has attempted to treat brain injured children by medicating them, and that such medications can have negative side effects. The IAHP claims that due to neuroplasticity, their programs of increased sensory stimulation can actually physically grow the brain and produce improved neurological function in their patients. Another aspect of the IAHP's theories is that a lack of oxygen to the brain is a key cause of many problems in brain-injured children. The IAHP asserts that their program includes techniques that improve this oxygen supply, and that increased oxygen to the brain will help their patients recover."}], "judgments": [{"rater": "4732663542444006289", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "6570687721363324718", "judgment": "yes"}, {"rater": "1264223381988340244", "judgment": "yes"}, {"rater": "1666978224370465111", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "6894531213122822459", "judgment": "no"}]}

It does not matter who 'invented' Marlon Brando or how regularly or faithfully he, Dean, or Clift attended the Studio or studied the Method at the feet of Lee Strasberg. In their signature roles -- the most influential performances in the history of American films -- these three performers revealed new kinds of body language and new ways of delivering dialogue. In the pauses between words, in the language 'spoken' by their eyes and faces, they gave psychological realism an unprecedented charge. Verbally inarticulate, they were eloquent 'speakers' of emotion. Far less protective of their masculinity than earlier film actors, they enacted emotionally wounded and vulnerable outsiders struggling for self-understanding, and their work shimmered with a mercurial neuroticism... The Method-trained performers in films of the fifties added an enhanced verbal and gesture naturalism and a more vivid inner life."}], "judgments": [{"rater": "6736745672381419418", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "3149241296119765999", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "1264223381988340244", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "13263558342802011415", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "3027237892993046497", "judgment": "no"}]}

(Later in life, Lincoln also joined the Delta Chi fraternity.) He then enrolled in Harvard Law School but did not graduate. Much to the embarrassment of the President, Mary Todd Lincoln prevented Robert Lincoln from joining the Union Army until shortly before the war's conclusion in 1865. He held the rank of captain, serving in the last weeks of the American Civil War as part of General Ulysses S. Grant's immediate staff, a position which sharply minimized the likelihood that he would be involved in actual combat. He was present at Appomattox when Lee surrendered. Lincoln had a distant relationship with his father, in part because Abraham Lincoln spent months on the judicial circuit during his formative years. Robert would later say his most vivid image of his father was of his packing his saddlebags to prepare for his travels through Illinois. Abraham Lincoln was proud of Robert and thought him bright, but also saw him as something of a competitor, and once said, ``he guessed Bob would not do better than he had.'' The two lacked the strong bond Lincoln had with his sons Willie and Tad, but Robert deeply admired his father and wept openly at his deathbed."}], "judgments": [{"rater": "10690115145453316046", "judgment": "yes"}, {"rater": "6968726908160095830", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "11594982675307016661", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "1264223381988340244", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "12022408018620867151", "judgment": "no"}]}

Wozniak, at first skeptical, was later convinced by Jobs that even if they were not successful they could at least say to their grandkids they had had their own company. Together they sold some of their possessions (such as Wozniak's HP scientific calculator and Jobs's Volkswagen van), raised USD $1,300, and assembled the first prototypes in Jobs's bedroom and later (when there was no space left) in Jobs' garage. Wozniak's apartment in San Jose was filled with monitors, electronic devices, and some computer games Wozniak had developed, similar to SuperPong but with voice overs to the blips on the screen. By 1971, one year after enrolling, Wozniak withdrew from the University of California, Berkeley and developed the computer that eventually made him famous. By himself he designed the hardware, circuit board designs, and operating system for the Apple I. With the Apple I design, he and Jobs were largely working to impress other members of the Palo Alto-based Homebrew Computer Club, a local group of electronics hobbyists very interested in computing, one of several key centers which established the home hobbyist era, essentially creating the microcomputer industry over several years. Unlike other Home Brew competitors, the Apple had an easy-to-achieve video capability that immediately created buzz and drew a crowd when it was unveiled."}], "judgments": [{"rater": "1295059937994543754", "judgment": "yes"}, {"rater": "10154575516167401232", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "16671464637895630418", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "652625289254394043", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "6063741883945424276", "judgment": "yes"}]}

This angered the liberals with Unitarian leanings. After much struggle the Unitarian Henry Ware was elected. This signaled a shift as Harvard Divinity drifted from orthodox Calvinist conservative roots towards liberalism and Unitarianism. Jedidiah Morse went on to found the Andover Newton Theological School as an orthodox alternative to the Harvard Divinity School. Harvard Divinity was very much a Unitarian school even before Unitarianism was defined. Harvard Divinity school became a national training ground hub for Unitarian ministers. Some orthodox and evangelical critics called this ``The Unitarian takeover of Harvard.'' William Ellery Channing, a Harvard graduate and minister revered by Ralph Waldo Emerson, steered Unitarianism into a public and what evangelicals consider, controversial course. He publicly preached against the Trinity and the Congregationalist (those holding the Puritan/Calvinist ideals that only the elect receive salvation) churches split in half. The vast majority of Old Light Congregationalist churches became Unitarian and held Unitarian doctrines. To this day Old Light Congregationalist churches still exist, but in small numbers. The quip was made by critics and then later embraced by the Boston community that, ``Unitarian preaching is limited to fatherhood of God, the brotherhood of man and the neighborhood of Boston.''"}], "judgments": [{"rater": "16959325387609365299", "judgment": "yes"}, {"rater": "3962649178407103196", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "1264223381988340244", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "6968726908160095830", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "3027237892993046497", "judgment": "no"}]}

Boatner) in 1954 and had four children: St. Clair ``Dan'' Streett III, born in California in 1955, who graduated from Virginia Military Institute in 1977, USAF Colonel Bryant Boatner Streett (VMI 1978) born at Fort Belvoir, Virginia in 1956, Monica Page Streett born in 1959 in Nurnberg, Germany, and Emily Williams Streett born in 1961 at West Point, NY. General Streett's son retired from the US Army after 21 years of service in the Infantry and the Engineers. Besides serving in combat in Korea, and in South Vietnam as an advisor, St. Clair Jr. had participated in the US Army Corps of Engineer construction projects for NASA (in the race to put a man on the moon before the end of the decade) at Cape Caniveral, Florida and Huntsville, Alabama. ``Bill'' Streett, Jr. married again in 1980 to Anitra Mae ``Sue'' Rustmeyer--the two had a daughter, Sarah Mae Streett, born the next year."}], "judgments": [{"rater": "6570687721363324718", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "6905422328658452998", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "1666978224370465111", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "18153321702395861849", "judgment": "yes"}, {"rater": "3027237892993046497", "judgment": "no"}]}

Roberts published his four-volume biography of Hannah More in 1834: its hagiographic tone and editorial inaccuracy drew the scorn of John Gibson Lockhart in the Quarterly but the inclusion of extended extracts from More's letters has ensured its enduring interest to those interested in More.

Two of his compositions from 1960, Piano Piece and String Quartet were published in An Anthology of Chance Operations (edited by Young in 1963). This publication led to the performance of both pieces in England by Cornelius Cardew and others (Garland and Young 2001). His early works are quiet, simple, and restrained, much like some of the early work of Morton Feldman, but generally more tonal.

Stewart was born in Melbourne into a wealthy Australian family with pastoral interests in the Bathurst district of New South Wales. He was a great grandson of Major General William Stewart (1769--1854) Lieutenant Governor of New South Wales from 1825 to 1827. Stewart received a spasmodic education at The Scots College, Sydney due to his parents' frequent travels, but developed a love of reading from long holidays spent in the library of his uncle's house (Abercrombie House) in Bathurst. The family moved to Paris when Stewart was in his late teens. He attended an English language school and then studied art. With other members of his family now based in England, Stewart settled in London where he worked from time to time as a journalist and became involved in radical politics. He mixed in literary circles and met Pamela Hansford Johnson and Dylan Thomas. He is said to have been banished from the poetry circle of Victor Neuburg, known for his occult interests, for making jokes about 'yogis and bogeys'. In 1936 he married the novelist Pamela Hansford Johnson (1s 1941, 1d 1944) with whom he collaborated on two thrillers under the name Nap Lombard. When the Second World War broke out he joined the British army and served as an officer in the artillery in India and Burma. After his divorce from Pamela Hansford Johnson, Stewart married Doreen Ellen Coulling in 1950 (1d 1952). Stewart returned to Australia in 1955 and worked in Sydney as a journalist for the mining and construction industry. He retired to Bathurst in 1983 where he died on 15 February 1999."}], "judgments": [{"rater": "675474584163354109", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "12022408018620867151", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "796504546363744426", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "6968726908160095830", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "6736745672381419418", "judgment": "no"}]}

The protest was started by the mother of a student who would not have been eligible for his graduate-level course in mathematical logic. Many intellectuals, led by John Dewey, protested against his treatment. Albert Einstein's often-quoted aphorism that ``Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds...'' originated in his open letter in support of Russell, during this time. Dewey and Horace M. Kallen edited a collection of articles on the CCNY affair in The Bertrand Russell Case. He soon joined the Barnes Foundation, lecturing to a varied audience on the history of philosophy; these lectures formed the basis of A History of Western Philosophy.

This novel caused dismay from the reactionary segment of society and loud applause from the critics and is considered a revolutionary departure from the traditional treatment of the feminine role in marriage. ``Breakthrough'' is a novel that ends with the heroine awareness that she didn't really need to depend upon a man in order to lead a fulfilling life. The book enjoyed an unexpected publishing success and went through five consecutive editions. Mercedes Valdivieso had the extreme audacity to become an innovator; she bridged the gap between romantic and domestic fiction in a society where women have been viewed as a sexless gender, icons of virtue, and depending on men to meet the necessities of life. Valdivieso also was founder and director of ``Adan'' a Men's Magazine, she published articles in newspapers and magazines and she gave many lectures and speeches.

Lauren Jackson, a lesbian BYU student, commented ``If BYU wants celibate students, it has every right to demand that and to limit behavior, but the issue with the Honor Code is not about lifestyle, it's about identity. Not being allowed to express an identity is very damaging.'' While both homosexuals and heterosexuals must abide by the church's law of chastity, the Honor Code additionally prohibits all forms of physical intimacy that give expression to homosexual feelings. There is no similarly spelled out restriction against expressing heterosexual feelings, although the church teaches that intimate heterosexual behaviors such as petting or fornication are unacceptable between unmarried couples. Advocacy of homosexuality and the promotion of homosexual relations as being morally acceptable was explicitly mentioned as ``against the honor code'' until a change of the Code in early 2011. It does make clear, however, that sexual orientation is not an honor code issue."}], "judgments": [{"rater": "12086754839319333463", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "1666978224370465111", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "6968726908160095830", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "11495735324295360935", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "796504546363744426", "judgment": "yes"}]}

They concluded each meeting with a reading of the latest Wesley correspondence describing the ongoing mission with the Moravian Brethren. In this way they practiced until John Wesley's return to England in 1738. It was during this period that another young Moravian missionary, Peter Boehler, enroute to America, was invited to one of these meetings at Fetter Lane. He had studied at the University of Jena and had been ordained by Count Zinzendorf. Peter's inspiring presence transformed Hutton's Society into ``The Great Meeting House'' which became the ``First Religious Society in Fetter Lane, London.'' This 1738 event could be described as planting the seed of the Moravian Church in England. This gathering, or ``Vestry Society,'' rightly considered themselves as part of the Church of England, and at times included members of the Holy Club. Peter Boehler established the rules he had learned under Zinzendorf, James Hutton presided, and Philip Henry Molther ministered. This society was repeatedly slandered for their ``non-traditional'' approach to Christianity.

One summer, Neil meets and falls in love with Brenda Patimkin, a student at Radcliffe College who is from a wealthy family living in the affluent suburb of Short Hills. The novella explores the level of classism which afflicts the relationship, despite the fact that Brenda's father, Ben, originally came from the same environment as Neil. The issue of assimilation is intrinsic as well, since Brenda is much more assimilated than Neil. The title, Goodbye, Columbus refers to a record Brenda's brother listens to about his years as an athlete at Ohio State University, further proof of the Patimkins' success at assimilation. As the book proceeds, Neil finds that their relationship is falling apart. It is finally realized that Neil and Brenda's relationship is not based on love but lust. Thus, the title may be seen as a metaphor for Neil saying goodbye to the affluent, assimilated world of the Patimkins."}], "judgments": [{"rater": "1666978224370465111", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "12075143618468024163", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "6570687721363324718", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "1295059937994543754", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "10906565243326693454", "judgment": "no"}]}

{"pred": "/people/person/education./education/education/institution", "sub": "Edward Montgomery", "obj": "University of Notre Dame", "evidences": [{"url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma_&_Greg", "snippet": "According to Chuck Lorre's eleventh vanity card (see below), he and Dottie Dartland originally conceived Dharma & Greg as ``a series revolving around a woman whose personality is not a neurotic product of societal and parental conditioning, but of her own free-flowing, compassionate mind''. Thomas Gibson as lawyer Gregory Clifford ``Greg'' Montgomery, Dharma's husband. He is an upright, uptight, decent, though sometimes surprisingly open-minded man. Greg's life was hopelessly banal before he met Dharma and married her on their first date. Since then, he has played straight man to the antics of his eccentric wife. Though his relationship with Dharma has been rocky at times, Greg has never been shown to regret their marriage. He is an alumnus of elite schools, Phillips Exeter Academy, Harvard University, and Stanford Law School. Susan Sullivan as Katherine ``Kitty'' Montgomery, Greg's extravagant mother. In the beginning of the first season Kitty was generally represented as a manipulative, controlling woman who only had higher aspirations for her son. As an elite socialite, Kitty was initially quite displeased to have Dharma and her parents join the family, but over the course of the series, Kitty broadens her limited country club world to become part of a larger family, becoming a major part of Dharma's life, while remaining lovingly manipulative. Mitchell Ryan as Edward Montgomery, Greg's eccentric father. His philosophy for dealing with his wife, Kitty, involves remaining as uninvolved as possible. Head of Montgomery Industries (though he keeps working only because he can see little tugboats out the window) and at odds with Dharma's father, who calls him ``Ed'' and whom he calls ``Finkelstein.'' Edward is a graduate of the University of Notre Dame, of which he is fiercely proud, and partially resents Greg for considering Notre Dame to not be ``good enough'' for him. Ed is often seen drinking martinis and Scotch. Mimi Kennedy as Abigail Kathleen ``Abby'' O'Neil, Dharma's free-spirited, caring mother, who encourages her daughter and son-in-law to produce children: ``Feel free to have sex anywhere.'' Although they have a grown daughter and later a son, she and Dharma's father are not married. She and Larry were engaged and held the wedding ceremony but still did not marry to ``stay under the radar''. Unlike her ``lifemate'' Larry, she immediately accepted Greg, though she still constantly annoys and conflicts with his parents. She is a militant vegan, which is a never-ending source of trouble. During her pregnancy in season 4, however, she did make exceptions because of her food cravings. Alan Rachins as Myron Lawrence ``Larry'' Finkelstein, Dharma's ``hippie'' father. He is a stereotypical sixties radical who frequently rants about various conspiracies, a lot of which revolve around Richard Nixon. He also thinks he's wanted by the FBI, but when Greg discovers he's not, his family goes to great lengths to prove to him that he still is because this is a source of great pride to him. Despite this, he manages to get along with Edward, often when both are sick of dealing with their wives. He homeschooled Dharma in American history, passing on his conspiracy theories, such as the latest Apollo mission secretly burying the missing minutes of the Watergate tapes on the moon. It is often alluded to that Larry is a chronic user of marijunana, though never shown. In the season 4 episode Mother Daughter Reunion, Dharma mentions that Larry has a resistance against most drugs after frequent use. In the pilot episode Abby introduces his usual cluelessness with ``he blew out his short term memory back in 1972''. He sometimes becomes a ``pothead savant'' and reveals skills such as his talent for carpentry and his music. Shae D'Lyn as Jane Deaux, Dharma's friend. She considers all men more or less evil; over the course of the show, her hair went from black, to red, to blonde. She married Pete Cavanaugh in Season 2, and made an attempt to divorce him after 6 weeks. They eventually divorced in the premiere of the fourth season. She and Dharma met when Dharma dialed a wrong number. D'Lyn left at the end of the fourth season, though she had one ``guest appearance'' in season five. Joel Murray as Peter James ``Pete'' Cavanaugh, Greg's friend and colleague at the Justice Department. A particularly bad, lazy lawyer, he was married to Jane for a time. His entire life can be summed up by the interior of his apartment: a massage chair surrounded by empty take-out containers, next to which is a small refrigerator and a stack of porno tapes. A high-class entertainment center is in front of this. It is said he wears adult diapers to football games. Greg once said of his friend: ``Pete went to law school in Barbados; he failed the Bar eight times. The last time because he threw up on the exam.'' In season 1, he mentions that he worked as a plumber's assistant during college. Pete marries Jane in the second season because neither of them wants to be alone on Valentine's Day Helen Greenberg as Marcie, One of Dharma's Co-Op friends; nasal-voiced receptionist, whose vocabulary primarily consists of the words ``I'm sorry.'' Greenberg joined the main cast in season five, she also played a different character in the episode ``Drop Dead Gorgeous''. Susan Chuang as Susan Wong, One of Dharma's friends from the Co-Op, she is seen as Marcie's counterpart. Susan also pulls a ``Dharma & Greg'' with a lawyer, Darrell Gottlieb, hired by Kitty in a community garden spat (her wedding, along with Dharma's accident, was the Season 4 finale). Chaung joined the main cast in season five, she also played a different character in the episode ``Looking for the Goodbars''."}], "judgments": [{"rater": "6968726908160095830", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "3027237892993046497", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "1264223381988340244", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "6063741883945424276", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "16959325387609365299", "judgment": "no"}]}

This set EE up to eventually be invited to perform at Pittsburgh, PA's annual Black Sheep Puppet Festival, appearing each year from 1999 to 2002. Thanks to David Marine's efforts as coordinator and set builder, they were also invited to participate in Chicago's Puppetropolis, a one-off puppetry festival held in 2001 at various locations in the city. As a puppetry troupe, EE staged various shows: ``The Ancient Astronauts of Ohm-Bah'', ``The Legend of the Piasa Bird'', and an aquatic-themed puppet play called ``Tofishy''. It was at this point that the group hit an all-time professional peak, participating in a number of city-sanctioned special events and even being asked to appear at a NASCAR event at the Chicagoland Speedway."}], "judgments": [{"rater": "652625289254394043", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "6968726908160095830", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "6736745672381419418", "judgment": "yes"}, {"rater": "6570687721363324718", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "7379787628707821873", "judgment": "no"}]}

Stekel had studied medicine at the University of Vienna under Richard von Krafft-Ebing. His conversion to psychoanalysis is variously attributed to his successful treatment by Freud for a sexual problem or as a result of his reading The Interpretation of Dreams, to which he subsequently gave a positive review in the Viennese daily newspaper Neues Wiener Tagblatt. The other three original members whom Freud invited to attend, Alfred Adler, Max Kahane, and Rudolf Reitler, were also physicians and all five were Jewish by birth. Both Kahane and Reitler were childhood friends of Freud. Kahane had attended the same secondary school and both he and Reitler went to university with Freud. They had kept abreast of Freud's developing ideas through their attendance at his Saturday evening lectures. In 1901, Kahane, who first introduced Stekel to Freud's work, had opened an out-patient psychotherapy institute of which he was the director in Bauernmarkt, in Vienna. In the same year, his medical textbook, Outline of Internal Medicine for Students and Practicing Physicians was published. In it, he provided an outline of Freud's psychoanalytic method. Kahane broke with Freud and left the Wednesday Psychological Society in 1907 for unknown reasons and in 1923 he committed suicide. Reitler was the director of an establishment providing thermal cures in Dorotheergasse which had been founded in 1901. He died prematurely in 1917. Adler, regarded as the most formidable intellect among the early Freud circle, was a socialist who in 1898 had written a health manual for the tailoring trade. He was particularly interested in the potential social impact of psychiatry. Max Graf, a Viennese musicologist and father of ``Little Hans'', who had first encountered Freud in 1900 and joined the Wednesday group soon after its initial inception, described the ritual and atmosphere of the early meetings of the society: The gatherings followed a definite ritual. First one of the members would present a paper. Then, black coffee and cakes were served; cigar and cigarettes were on the table and were consumed in great quantities. After a social quarter of an hour, the discussion would begin. The last and decisive word was always spoken by Freud himself. There was the atmosphere of the foundation of a religion in that room. Freud himself was its new prophet who made the heretofore prevailing methods of psychological investigation appear superficial. By 1906 the group had grown to sixteen members, including Otto Rank, who was employed as the group's paid secretary. Also in that year Freud began correspondence with Jung who was then an assistant to Eugen Bleuler at the Burgh\u00f6lzli Mental Hospital in Zurich. In March 1907 Jung and Ludwig Binswanger, also a Swiss psychiatrist, travelled to Vienna to visit Freud and attend the discussion group. Thereafter they established a small psychoanalytic group in Zurich. In 1908, reflecting its growing institutional status, the Wednesday group was renamed the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society."}], "judgments": [{"rater": "16959325387609365299", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "16671464637895630418", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "6968726908160095830", "judgment": "yes"}, {"rater": "15508466506567648824", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "10690115145453316046", "judgment": "yes"}]}

Writers whose early work was published in these anthologies include Dylan Thomas, Marianne Moore, Wallace Stevens, Thomas Merton, Denise Levertov, James Agee, and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. The New Directions ``annuals,'' soon broadened their focus to include quality contemporary writing of all genres, though the work included tended to represent a more intellectual side of American writing as well as a considerable amount of literature in translation from modernist authors around the world.

She first wrote La Brecha (``Breakthrough'') in 1961, which is considered to be the first feminist Latin-American novel. This novel caused dismay from the reactionary segment of society and loud applause from the critics and is considered a revolutionary departure from the traditional treatment of the feminine role in marriage. ``Breakthrough'' is a novel that ends with the heroine awareness that she didn't really need to depend upon a man in order to lead a fulfilling life. The book enjoyed an unexpected publishing success and went through five consecutive editions. Mercedes Valdivieso had the extreme audacity to become an innovator; she bridged the gap between romantic and domestic fiction in a society where women have been viewed as a sexless gender, icons of virtue, and depending on men to meet the necessities of life. Valdivieso also was founder and director of ``Adan'' a Men's Magazine, she published articles in newspapers and magazines and she gave many lectures and speeches. She taught literature at the University of Peking, at the University of Houston, at Stephen F.

In 1717 his grandfather died, and he inherited Ote Hall and some funds, which he used to purchase a clerkship in London. About the same time he married Frances Barker, with whom he had a large number of children. He was called to the bar in 1720. Although his inheritance had been substantial (about \u00a310,000), he cultivated an expensive lifestyle, and suffered significant financial reverses in the depression of 1721.

Foote or Jonathan Lipe Foote is an American architect whose work is associated with the preservation movement in the U.S. Although the term traces back to the 1920s, Foote is primarily linked to the movement's urgent push and wider acceptance following the demolition of New York City's monumental Pennsylvania Station in 1964. F was an early proponent and pioneered current trends of historic renovation, ``regional design,'' and ``historic preservation'' for private and public works throughout rural and urban parts of New England during the 1960s. He is more broadly noted in the American Northwest for a large variety of projects that date back to the 1970s. He is recognized for innovative reuse of indigeonous hand hewn timbers, stone and sensitive siting of buildings in their natural environment. Together in 2006, Buck Brannaman and Jon Foote received honorary doctorate degrees from Montana State University. During a speech, Brannaman, who is the real-life ``Horse Whisperer'' and an inspiration for Redford's movie, publicly credited Foote ``for supporting me when I was young, broke, and nobody cared who I was, and for doing it without motive or gain.'' Foote was acknowledged by MSU for his contributions to the state of Montana in Architecture and Art. The architect was born in London England in 1935, and is the second son of U.S. Col. Ray Palmer Foote and Rosann Lipe Foote Smith. Relatives: Foote is a direct descendant of Elizabeth Deming and Nathaniel Foote, who settled Wethersfield, Connecticut in 1636. Education: Phillips Academy (Andover), Yale Bachelor of Arts 1958, attended Rhode Island School of Design 1959 and received a Bachelor of Architecture and a Masters of Architecture 1964 from The Yale University School of Architecture.
