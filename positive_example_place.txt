The following year he took a position at the University of Rochester. Perkins was drafted in World War I, and entered service in June 1918. He joined the 87th Division, and shortly after it arrived in France he was commissioned as a first lieutenant and sent to Chaumont, where the AEF had its headquarters. Perkins was assigned to the historical section, where he found a former teacher of his from Harvard and others whom he had known from Harvard. Upon his return to civilian life in July 1919, he resumed his appointment at the University of Rochester, where he remained on the faculty until 1953. In 1925 he became chair of the history department. From 1928 to 1932, Perkins was secretary to the American Historical Association, succeeded by Conyers Read. In 1945 he was the first to hold Cambridge University's Pitt Professor of American History and Institutions. Dr. Perkins was also the John L.

He acted for many years as an evangelist, and not infrequently in the open air or by the wayside. He had small charges in the Isle of Man and Helensburgh. Ultimately he accepted the appointment of pastor over a very small independent congregation in the village of Blackburn, Linlithgowshire, from which, it is believed, he never received more than 25l. to 30l. a year. He also kept a day-school on his own account. It was in this humble position that Boag compiled his magnum opus. His aim was to combine etymology, pronunciation, and explanation of scientific terms and others used in art and literature. He wished also to incorporate (1) new words since Johnson, and (2) modifications and other changes of meanings. He commenced this arduous undertaking after he had entered his seventieth year. Within three years his manuscript was ready for the press. It was printed and published by the Edinburgh Printing and Publishing Company. Unfortunately this company speedily became bankrupt. About 1847 Messrs. Fullarton & Co. became proprietors of the ''Imperial Lexicon,`` and issued it in parts or numbers, constituting two massive volumes. The work had an enormous sale and held its own until the publication of Ogilvie's Dictionary, which was largely based upon it. Prefixed was a ''Popular Grammar of the English Language,`` by Mr. R. Whyte. Besides his ''Imperial Lexicon,`` Boag was the author of a number of pamphlets on questions of the day, and was a frequent contributor to contemporary religious periodicals."}], 'judgments': [{'rater': '16169597761094238409', 'judgment': 'yes'}, {'rater': '2050861176556883424', 'judgment': 'yes'}, {'rater': '11658533362118524115', 'judgment': 'yes'}, {'rater': '16651790297630307764', 'judgment': 'yes'}, {'rater': '11595942516201422884', 'judgment': 'yes'}]}{'pred': '/people/person/place_of_birth', 'sub': '/m/05mxf4y', 'obj': '/m/0c769z', 'evidences': [{'url': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidia_Elsa_Satragno', 'snippet': "Lidia Elsa Satragno was born in the western Buenos Aires suburb of San Justo in 1935.

He married in 1801 or 1802, and by this means was enabled to improve his condition very materially. He removed to London and became a secretary to one Bell first of all, and afterwards to Nathaniel M. Rothschild. In 1838 he was selected with five others, in connection with the Abergavenny Eisteddfod, to improve the Welsh Orthography. Nothing, however, came from the united action of these men; but in 1845 Edwards published his 'Analysis of Welsh Orthography. ' He was for many years a member of the 'Cymmrodorion' and delivered many of their lectures; that on 'Currency' was afterwards published.

Her father Volodymir Poryvai and her mother Ludmila Poryvai (maiden name Bystrik) were conductors of the Kiev Teachers Choir Cappella ``Svitoch''. From an early age, Russya had an intense interest in music, especially Ukrainian folk music and European classical music.She started her first pianolessons at age 5 and continued studying through graduation from high school. Later, she was enrolled at Kiev Music College, named after composer Glier, where she studied piano and choirconducting. Shortly before graduating from College she met and latter married Konstantin Ossaoulenko, musician and songwriter. Together they formed a team and became one of the most successful performer-songwriter teams in Ukrainian pop music of late 80's and early 90's. Russya's first album ``The Fortuneteller'' 1989, was a major success. The album contained 3 Top 10 Ukrainian hits, #1 ``Don't Stand By My Window', ''The Mermaid``, and the title track itself, ''The Fortuneteller. The follow-up album, ``The Enchanted Circle'' in 1989, brought her wide recognition in Ukraine and another #1 title song. The following year 1990, she released the album, ``Forgive Me Mommy''. This album won her the title, Best Female Artist of Ukraine. The album spawned another #1 ``Forgive me Mommy'' and three more Ukrainian Top 10 songs, ``Whatever Will Be, Will Be'', ``Let Them Talk'', and ``Little Swan''. In the summer and fall of 1990 Russya continued touring in support of the album, ``Forgive Me Mommy''. The fourth album, ``Cinderella'', was released in May 1991 . The song ``Blondie Girl'' went straight to #1 for the entire summer of 1991. The album also produced two more Ukrainian top 10 songs, ``Cinderella'' and ``Don't Forget''. For the second time, back to back in 1991, she won The Best Female Artist of Ukraine award. In late 1991, Russya traveled to Canada to record an album for the Yevshan Ukrainian record label in Montreal. It was her first release of an album in Canada and the United States. The album was entitled just simply ``Russya''. She remained in Canada to support the album release and performed at concerts in Ukrainian clubs and Churches throughout Canada and the United States. In 1993 after the untimely death of her father, she returned to the studio to record an album of classical Ukrainian pop songs, ``Cheremshyna'', dedicated to the memory of her parent. The album was released in 1994. It did not receive the high acclaim of her previous albums mainly due to the difference in style and genre. The same year she went back into the studio and recorded the album, ``Kiyv Girl''. The title song made its way into the Ukrainian top 10 in 1994. The next album, ``My American Guy'' was released in 1997. Russya retired from recording pop music in 1997 but continued to tour, sometimes with her sister Natasha Koroleva til 1999. In 2007 she returned to the recording studio and released her CD entitled, ``The Best Of Russya''. In 2009 she recorded new album ``Small Presents'' It is her first release since 1997 in presenting new songs in more than 12 years."}], 'judgments': [{'rater': '16169597761094238409', 'judgment': 'yes'}, {'rater': '16651790297630307764', 'judgment': 'yes'}, {'rater': '2050861176556883424', 'judgment': 'yes'}, {'rater': '1014448455121957356', 'judgment': 'no'}, {'rater': '11595942516201422884', 'judgment': 'yes'}]}{'pred': '/people/person/place_of_birth', 'sub': '/m/02rq8cs', 'obj': '/m/01jp4s', 'evidences': [{'url': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Alessandro_Furietti', 'snippet': "Furietti was born at Bergamo, the son of Giovanni Marco Sonzogni Furietti, noble, of a local branch of the Sonzogni.

One account given of his history states that his proper name was Philippe, and that he served as a French officer in the campaign in Flanders, but afterwards devoted himself to the pursuit of art. He was endowed with extraordinary capacity; and had his application been but equal to his genius, few would have surpassed him in the branch of art to which his natural disposition directed him. He had a peculiar talent for drawing landscapes, either from nature or his own fancy, with a readiness that was altogether surprising. Unfortunately, from his idle and dissolute course of life, he seldom exercised his abilities until compelled by necessity. The drawings, in chalk and with the pen, which he has left make us deeply regret that the irregularity of his life has limited these admirable productions to a much smaller number than his uncommon facility would otherwise have secured to us. Chatelain was much employed by Boydell, especially in engraving with Vivares the series of landscapes after Claude, Rembrandt, Guaspre, and others. Vivares being more appreciated by the public, his name was often placed on plates engraved by Chatelain alone, as in the case of a fine landscape after Pietro da Cortona, and another named 'The Storm,' in which Poussin has introduced the story of Pyramus and Thisbe. He engraved, also for Boydell, eleven views in London and in Italy. He died in London in 1771.

His early works in the 1980s were influenced by Maceda in the use of large numbers of performers, while in the 1990s he experimented with various methods by which the audience becomes integral in the performance. At the beginning of the new century, Baes experiments with notions of structure-agency integration ((Anthony Giddens)) and simulacrum ((Jean Baudrillard)).

Her first competition event was in the 2006 German national race, where she disqualified in the Slalom and did not finish the Giant Slalom. She has competed since then in a variety of alpine skiing events, including the slalom, giant slalom, downhill, and super combined, at a number of junior international competitions, although she is listed by the International Ski Federation as having not finished more than half of the races she has entered. As of February, 2010, her best finish in any competition was 2nd, at a giant slalom event in Germany. Oettl Reyes was selected at the age of 18 to be one of three members of Peru's delegation to the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Canada, the first Peruvian team to participate in the Winter Olympics. Her younger brother Manfred Oettl Reyes, also an alpine skier, was selected for the team as well. She is scheduled to compete in both the slalom and giant slalom competitions there, although she was not expected to be in serious competition for a medal. Her participation on behalf of Peru was questioned by some, as she was not only born in Germany but lives there and is of Peruvian descent on only one side of her family. She and her brother were last minute additions to the Olympic roster. They both met the minimum time qualifications for participation, but that participation was questioned as neither had taken part in a World Championship prior to the Olympics. In response to this criticism, the Peruvian Olympic Committee explained that they were in the process of receiving their Peruvian passports when the last World Championships took place, and so could not yet compete on behalf of Peru. The controversy also prompted some commenters to question why the Peruvian government has not done more to identify and develop athletes within the country. However, the practice of smaller countries sending athletes who are technically citizens of those countries but who reside elsewhere to participate in international competitions is not uncommon. Despite the controversy, the pair asked Peruvians to embrace them and their participation on behalf of Peru at the Olympics."}], 'judgments': [{'rater': '16651790297630307764', 'judgment': 'yes'}, {'rater': '11595942516201422884', 'judgment': 'yes'}, {'rater': '17082466750572480596', 'judgment': 'yes'}, {'rater': '1014448455121957356', 'judgment': 'yes'}, {'rater': '16169597761094238409', 'judgment': 'yes'}]}{'pred': '/people/person/place_of_birth', 'sub': '/m/0gvr7s1', 'obj': '/m/07k9s4', 'evidences': [{'url': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_C._West', 'snippet': 'Stephen West was born on 11 April 1952 in North Ferriby, Yorkshire, to Joseph Clair West, a fishbuyer, and Louise West.

He met Adolf Hitler at a dinner party in Heidelberg in 1932. Hitler pointed out that blacks have no voting rights, and criticized them for being docile about their oppression, saying ``Negroes must be definitely third-class people to allow whites to lynch them, beat them, segregate them, without rising up against them!'' The Pittsburgh Courier ran a front page article on the conversation shortly after the USA entered the Second World War. Wright noted that throughout the conversation, Hitler though calm, asked questions and immediately gave his own answers. For example, he asked ``Don't you think your people are destined perpetually to be slaves of one kind or another?'' and replied ``Yes! Your people are a hopeless lot. I don't hate them... I pity the poor devils.'' The conversation was dramatically reenacted in 1944 on the anti-racist radio show New World A-Coming.

He was then hired by the ABC Radio network, and the reputation built from these broadcasts led to a recording contract with Mercury Records. His highest success in the U.S. charts was a cover of ``Skokiaan'' in 1954. In 1953 he recorded a version of Bill Haley's ``Crazy, Man, Crazy'', which is generally regarded as the first rock and roll song. His version of ``Crazy, Man, Crazy'' reached #13 on the Billboard jockey chart and #11 on Cashbox in June, 1953. His recordings of ``Pretend'' and ``Caravan'' also made the Top 10. ``Caravan'' sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. In 1957, he hit #25 on the Billboard Hot 100 with ``Tricky'', and in 1957 he hit #10 with ``Shish-Kebab''. His compositions included ``Dancing Trumpet'', ``Dry Marterie'', and ``Carla''.

During his time with the agency he travelled the globe, bearing first hand witness to events of historical importance. Covering natural catastrophes, civil and ethnic wars, and urban riots, he came face to face with the complexity of the human condition and the random events by which it is fashioned. His thirst for freedom and an imperious need for self-expression rapidly convinced him to go freelance. Reserving himself the right to focus on the world's most important issues, he delivers startling images filtered through an ever-evolving aesthetic prism. Constantly breaking down barriers, he is, by turn, a photographer working on communication campaigns, and an investigator deconstructing the great sagas of contemporary life for the international portrait press for which his photographs of athletes, artists, ecclesiastics and politicians have become iconic. His images have earned him a number of prizes, including four prestigious World Press Awards. Following his domain of predilection, in a ``journey to the heart of man'' he becomes the wakeful observer of his contemporaries. This marginal perspective involves real mises en scène, veritable simulacra of the world in which we live. Internationally renowned, Gérard Rancinan's work is exhibited in the world's most prestigious galleries and museums and features in the most important contemporary art collections.

After receiving an elementary education at the local school, he became an apprentice to John Ferguson, an Aspatria coach-builder of some repute. At work he had a meteoric rise; he trained as a wheelwright, developed into a draughtsman, and became Works Manager, before the age of twenty-five. Casson was also a small time bicycle manufacturer in his own right, building his first bike simply because none of the ones on the market fitted his requirements. According to contemporary reports the finished design was not too dissimilar to the modern cycle. A close friend and fellow Aspatrian, Thomas Walker, founder of the Cockermouth monumental masons firm of Walker Brothers, bought one. Walker was apprenticed to Henry Graves, quarry owner and mason, who in his capacity of foreman supervised the building of Aspatria vicarage, and the churches of Bridekirk and Silloth. According to Walker, the sight of Casson speeding along the streets of Aspatria with his feet resting on the handlebars brought terror to the entire neighbourhood. He also enrolled for part time education at the newly established Aspatria Agricultural College and became one of the institutions earliest successes. In 1875, the court of the Worshipful Company of Coachmakers and Coach Harness Makers of London bestowed a number of honours. He obtained a First Class prize for plane, practical and solid geometry; a Second Class prize for theoretical mechanics; a Bronze Medal and a technology prize of two guineas. While at the 'Technology of Carriage Making' examination, held on behalf of the Royal Society of Arts he gained an additional First Class Certificate and a prize of £5.

Kutako, alongside Rev. Michael Scott led petitions to the United Nations which eventually led to the recognition of Namibia's status as a sovereign country under colonial control by South Africa. He was also the Leader of Hereroland from 1968-1970. In 1920, Hosea Kutako was officially appointed as leader of the Herero by Frederik Maharero. Frederik had been empowered to transfer power by his father, Herero chief Samuel Maharero, who had been exiled after the Herero War and was since banned from entering the country by the South African Mandatory Administration. Hosea Kutako took over his role as a commitment to preserve the memory of the glorious times of the Herero before and during the German colonisation as well as of the atrocities in the battle of Waterberg. Already in 1920, he founded the Green Flags, an association to keep up tradition, and went on by founding the Red Flags in 1923, after Samuel Maharero's death. Kutako prompted and organised the transfer of Samuel Maharero's body and its funeral on Okahandja next to the grave of Jonker Afrikaner. Kutako also founded the Truppenspieler association. It was meant to get military importance which was opposed both by the South African authorities and by Sam Nujoma, the co-founder of the South West African People's Organisation SWAPO. So, the Truppenspieler had to content themselves with an accompanying role at Herero Day. Along with Nujoma, Hosea Kutako founded the South West African National Union (SWANU) in 1959, an organisation that was to merge into SWAPO a year later. It later re-emerged as a separate political entity. Despite his age, Hosea Kutako particularly engaged for the independence of future Namibia. Windhoek's international airport, the country's primary international airport, is named after him. In July 2010, Kutako's former home in the Omaheke Region was nominated by the Omaheke Regional Council to become a national heritage site."}], 'judgments': [{'rater': '16169597761094238409', 'judgment': 'yes'}, {'rater': '11658533362118524115', 'judgment': 'yes'}, {'rater': '16651790297630307764', 'judgment': 'yes'}, {'rater': '17082466750572480596', 'judgment': 'yes'}, {'rater': '1855142007844680025', 'judgment': 'yes'}]}{'pred': '/people/person/place_of_birth', 'sub': '/m/02r1x33', 'obj': '/m/08_9vl', 'evidences': [{'url': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epeli_Ruivadra', 'snippet': 'Epeli Ruivadra (born 1 June 1977 in Nausori) is a Fijian rugby union footballer.

Many of the Emerson men attended Harvard, and the family was generally respected and genteel though not wealthy, integrally involved in the New England Calvinist milieu (Cole Origins chpt 1)."}], 'judgments': [{'rater': '16169597761094238409', 'judgment': 'yes'}, {'rater': '2050861176556883424', 'judgment': 'yes'}, {'rater': '17082466750572480596', 'judgment': 'yes'}, {'rater': '11595942516201422884', 'judgment': 'yes'}, {'rater': '16651790297630307764', 'judgment': 'yes'}]}{'pred': '/people/person/place_of_birth', 'sub': '/m/0dsbjk4', 'obj': '/m/05ywg', 'evidences': [{'url': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alois_Wachsman', 'snippet': 'Alois Wachsman (14 May 1898 Prague - 16 May 1942 Jičín) was a Czech painter, stage designer and architect.'}], 'judgments': [{'rater': '1855142007844680025', 'judgment': 'yes'}, {'rater': '16169597761094238409', 'judgment': 'yes'}, {'rater': '16651790297630307764', 'judgment': 'yes'}, {'rater': '5505751039176460562', 'judgment': 'yes'}, {'rater': '1014448455121957356', 'judgment': 'yes'}]}{'pred': '/people/person/place_of_birth', 'sub': '/m/04b4xd', 'obj': '/m/01zk9d', 'evidences': [{'url': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Borwein', 'snippet': 'Jonathan Michael Borwein (born 20 May 1951, St. Andrews, Scotland) is a Scottish mathematician who holds an appointment as Laureate Professor of mathematics at the University of Newcastle, Australia.

He married Jane Cunningham, known as ``Jennie June'', in 1856. In 1863, during the Civil War, he co-authored the anonymous pamphlet Miscegenation, which tried to discredit the Abolitionist movement and the Lincoln Administration by playing on racist fears common among whites. The anonymous author of the pamphlet claimed to be an Abolitionist in favour of promoting the intermarriage of whites and blacks, a taboo practice that at the time was seen as a threat to white supremacy. The pamphlet coined the term miscegenation for the intermixing of races. From 1870 to 1873, Croly published a journal called Modern Thinker which served as a vehicle for the positivist and Spencerian positions of himself and a small circle of colleagues, including John Humphrey Noyes. In 1872, Croly predicted the Panic of 1873, along with the failures of Jay Cooke & Co. and the Northern Pacific Railroad.

Majoring in musical composition, he drew influences from visiting composers who came through, including John Cage, Robert Ashley, Frederic Rzewski, and Elliot Carter. At the same time, however, he found himself drawn more to improvisation, and, despite a rather late start, took up jazz piano. (As a teenager, he had already played harmonica in a blues band.) In 1980 Esposito moved to New York City, where he worked with saxophonist Arthur Rhames, a neglected, almost forgotten figure who died of AIDS-related illness at 32 (1989), and who some nevertheless feel was the successor to John Coltrane's mantle as the greatest creative performer on that instrument."}], 'judgments': [{'rater': '17082466750572480596', 'judgment': 'yes'}, {'rater': '11595942516201422884', 'judgment': 'yes'}, {'rater': '2050861176556883424', 'judgment': 'yes'}, {'rater': '16651790297630307764', 'judgment': 'yes'}, {'rater': '16169597761094238409', 'judgment': 'yes'}]}{'pred': '/people/person/place_of_birth', 'sub': '/m/0fpj10g', 'obj': '/m/09c7w0', 'evidences': [{'url': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaux_Williamson', 'snippet': 'Margaux Williamson is a Canadian artist, born in the United States.

George Grote (1794--1871) v. was his first cousin on his mother's side. He was a king's scholar of Westminster School, and matriculated at Oxford as a student of Christ Church on 21 May 1819 (Foster, Alumni Oxon. 1715--1886, ii. 563). In 1822 he took a second class in classics, and graduated B.A. on 8 Feb. 1823, M.A. on 25 May 1825. An injury to his eyesight prevented his studying for the bar, and he took holy orders in 1825. He was curate for a short time (in 1828) at Drayton-Bassett, near Tamworth, and from 1830 to 1837 was curate of St. Chad's, Lichfield. During part of the time he was also morning lecturer at St. Mary's, Lichfield. An earnest high churchman, he threw himself with eagerness into the Tractarian movement of 1833, and tried to popularise its teaching. In 1835 he published ''Ecclesiastes Anglicanus: being a Treatise on the Art of Preaching as adapted to a Church of England Congregation,`` and in 1838 his ''Portrait of an English Churchman,`` which ran through many editions. In 1839 he began, in conjunction with Edward Churton v., a series of religious and social tales under the general title of ''The Englishman's Library,`` 31 vols., 12mo, London, 1840--39--46. Of these tales he wrote six: 1. ''Clement Walton, or the English Citizen`` (vol. i.). 2. ''The Siege of Lichfield, a Tale illustrative of the Great Rebellion`` (vol. xiii.). 3. ''Charles Lever, or the Man of the Nineteenth Century`` (vol. xv.). 4. ''The Forest of Arden, a Tale Illustrative of the English Reformation`` (vol. xix.). 5. ''Church-Clavering, or The Schoolmaster`` (vol. xxiv.), in which he developed his views on education. 6. ''Coniston Hall, or the Jacobites`` (vol. xxxi.). In November 1840 Gresley became a prebendary in Lichfield Cathedral, an honorary preferment (Le Neve, Fasti, ed. Hardy, i. 642). To describe the influence upon his own mind of the Oxford movement, and to illustrate the ''danger of dissent,`` he wrote ''Bernard Leslie, or a Tale of the Last Ten Years,`` 2 pts., 12mo, London, 1842, 1859. To ''The Juvenile Englishman's Library`` (21 vols., 1845--44--49), edited successively by his friends F. E. Paget and J. F. Russell, he contributed ''Henri de Clermont, or the Royalists of La Vendée: a Tale of the French Revolution`` (vol. iii.), and ''Colton Green, a Tale of the Black Country`` (vol. xv.). About 1850 Gresley removed to Brighton, and acted as a volunteer assistant priest in the church of St. Paul. He preached every Sunday evening, worked untiringly among rich and poor alike, and exercised much power as a confessor. His ''Ordinance of Confession,`` published in 1851, caused considerable stir, although he did not wish to make confession compulsory. In 1857 he accepted the perpetual curacy of All Saints, Boyne Hill, near Maidenhead, Berkshire, where a church, parsonage-house, and schools were in course of erection at the expense of three ladies living in the Oxford diocese. He settled there before either church or house was ready, and worked there with great success. His schools obtained a specially high reputation. Later in life Gresley, with a view to checking the spread of scepticism, published ''Sophron and Neologus, or Common Sense Philosophy,`` in 1861; ''Thoughts on the Bible,`` in 1871; ''Priests and Philosophers,`` in 1873; and ''Thoughts on Religion and Philosophy,`` in 1875. From the last two of these works selections, under the title of ''The Scepticism of the Nineteenth Century,`` were published, with a short account of the author, and portrait, by a former curate, S. C. Austen, in 1879. Gresley died at Boyne Hill on 19 Nov. 1876, and was buried in the churchyard. In 1828 he married Anne Wright, daughter and heiress of John Barker Scott, banker, of Lichfield, and had by her nine children, all of whom he survived. His other writings include: 1. ''Sermons on some of the Social and Political Duties of a Christian,`` 12mo, London, 1836. 2. ''The Necessity of Zeal and Moderation in the present circumstances of the Church enforced and illustrated in Five Sermons preached before the University of Oxford,`` 12mo, London, 1839. 3.

His chief patron was Lucullus, whose gentile name he assumed. In 93 BC he visited Sicily with his patron, on which occasion he received the citizenship of Lucanian Heraclea, one of the federate towns, and indirectly, by the provisions of the Lex Plautia Papiria, that of Rome. In 62 BC he was accused by a certain Gratius of having assumed the citizenship illegally; and Cicero successfully defended him in his speech Pro Archia. This speech, which furnishes nearly all the information concerning Archias, states that he had celebrated the deeds of Gaius Marius and Lucullus in the Cimbrian and Mithridatic Wars, and that he was engaged upon a poem of which the events of Cicero's consulship formed the subject.

Encouraged by her father to study, she mastered several modern and ancient languages (including Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic) and science. She rendered into English De Crousaz's Examen de l'essai de Monsieur Pope sur l'homme (Examination of Mr Pope's ``An Essay on Man'', two volumes, 1739); Algarotti's Newtonianismo per le donne (Newtonianism for women); and wrote a small volume of poems. Carter's position in the pantheon of eighteenth century women writers was, however, secured by her translation in 1758 of All the Works of Epictetus, Which are Now Extant, the first English translation of all known works by the Greek stoic philosopher. This work made her name and fortune, securing her a spectacular £1000 in subscription money. She was a friend of Samuel Johnson, editing some editions of his periodical The Rambler. He wrote that ``my old friend, Mrs Carter could make a pudding just as well as translate Epictetus... and work a handkerchief just as well as compose a poem'').

This volume received the Puerto Rican Pen Club Poetry Prize in 2004. Quintero Herencia has published other collections of poetry such as La caja negra (1996, Isla Negra) and Libro del sigiloso (2007, Terranova). Quintero Herencia's poetry is complex and contains an intense desire for experimentation and baroque imagery. In Quintero's recent poetry a concern for the specific nature of the political gesture of poetry is a recurrent topic. As an essayist Quintero-Herencia established himself with Fulguración del espacio: Letras e imaginario institucional de la Revolución cubana (1960--1971) (Beatriz Viterbo, 2002), a contextual and critical reading of the crucial debates which defined the Cuban intellectual field during the 1960``s. His second book, La máquina de la salsa: Tránsitos del sabor (Ediciones Vértigo, 2005) has been hailed by Puerto Rican critics as the most comprehensive critical balance on the Salsa phenomenon.

Some twelve years later his parents removed to London, where therefore, as a boy he received his education. After attending one or two preparatory schools, in 1853 he entered St. John's Foundation School which was then at Kilburn. At the age of seventeen he commenced to help his father, a leather merchant, and about the same time he began collecting beetles, some of his favourite haunts being Ken Wood and Hammersmith Marshes, as well as the sandy shores about Deal and Dover. As it was found that he had a great distaste for a business life, it was decided that he should qualify as a doctor. He accordingly, after studying for two years at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, went to the University of Edinburgh, where he obtained the degree of Bachelor of Medicine in 1866. After graduation he assisted a friend with his practice in London for a year or two. He had at first some thought of seeking an appointment in connection with entomology at the British Museum, but abandoned the idea; and about ten years later he went so far as to apply for the post of Curator of the City of Glasgow Industrial Museum, being recommended by H.W. Bates and Frederick Smith amongst others. However, after his short residence in London he was offered a post as medical officer in the Crichton Asylum at Dumfries, which led to his taking charge of a case at Thornhill in the neighbourhood, where he joined the Dumfriesshire and Galloway Scientific, Natural History, and Antiquarian Society upon its reconstruction in 1876. This engagement gave him the leisure he desired for prosecuting the studies on which his heart was set, and it was during this period that he published some of his earlier papers. Here also his marriage took place. On the death of his patient about 1882 he returned to England and went to live at Southampton, but, finding it too far from London, after about two years he removed to Dartford. In 1885 he was invited to go to Cambridge as Curator of the University Museum. There he spent the next nineteen years of his life, till in 1904 he retired to Brockenhurst, where he had built a residence, Lawnside, on the very edge of the New Forest, facing the extensive heath of Black Knowl.

In 1807 he went to Paris, where he studied oil painting. The year 1812 found him at Rome, and there his education as an artist was much advanced by his connection with Koch, Overbeck, Schadow, and Cornelius. His inclination led him more especially in the direction of painting landscapes with architectural details or prominent figures introduced. He attached himself to the new classic school of landscape, labouring especially to make his perspective tell effectively, and to gain a great mastery over light and shade. His ideas gained much in point of breadth from a visit to Sicily, which he made in company with Prince Golitsuin in 1818. He settled at Macerata in 1830, but returned home on a visit in 1840, on which occasion a professorship was bestowed on him by the King of Prussia. Amongst Catel's landscape subjects, which are marred by a certain touch of conventionality, the best perhaps are 'The Moonlight View of the Colonnade of St. Peter's,' and 'The Storm on Mount Etna. ' In the Berlin Gallery are two Neapolitan views, both painted in 1822, and in the New Pinakothek, Munich, are eight works by him, views in Italy. His works may be seen in Munich and Copenhagen.

In October 1838 he was entered at Trinity College, Cambridge, where in 1841 he was elected a scholar. He was reading with good hopes for classical honours, and was a private pupil of Dr. Vaughan; but even at that early age he was suffering from the disease to which he eventually succumbed. Although the state of his health prevented him from competing for university honours or obtaining a college fellowship, he was known to possess ability; and soon after taking his degree he was appointed college librarian (4 June 1845). He held this office until a few weeks before his death, when he returned to his father's house. Physical weakness prevented the sustained effort necessary for the production of any important work; but for the last six years of his life he contributed to the press. Most of his writings appeared in the Spectator or in Fraser's Magazine, the only one to which his name was attached being an essay on Tennyson's poems, contributed to the Cambridge Essays of 1855. He died 29 May 1857. A selection of his essays was made after his death and published with a prefatory memoir by W. G. Clark. This volume contains notices of a large number of the writers who were contemporary with Brimley himself, and is of considerable value as representing the contemporary judgment by a man of cultivation and acuteness on the writers of the middle of the nineteenth century, most of whom are now being judged by posterity. Sir Arthur Helps said of him, 'He was certainly, as it appeared to me, one of the finest critics of the present day.
