After a brief time in Brooklyn, New York, the family relocated to the coal-mining city of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, when George was thirteen years old. Involved with his high school newspaper, he landed a job after high school as a reporter for the Wilkes-Barre Record. He briefly attended Columbia University to pursue studies in English and history in 1921-1922, but was forced to return home by his family's financial difficulties. Upon his return he joined the staff of the Pottsville Republican. Assigned to cover miners and their families in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, he began collecting songs and stories from them for special features and educated himself in folklore and folk song studies of the period and region. The collection was unprecedented because folklorists previously had concentrated mostly on rural Anglo-American balladry of mountaineers, cowboys, and lumbermen. His collection drew attention for showing emergent folklore of industrial life, labor movements, and immigrant traditions in a mixed-ethnic social context. In 1927, he issued his collections in book form as Songs and Ballads of the Anthracite Miner, followed by publications that included narrative and customary traditions of coal miners, such as Black Rock: Mining Folklore of the Pennsylvania Dutch (1960, winner of the Chicago Folklore Prize in that year), Coal Dust on the Fiddle: Songs and Stories of the Bituminous Industry (1943), and his essay on ``coal miners' for Pennsylvania Songs and Legends (1949), which he edited. In 1936, he became director of the Pennsylvania Folk Festival, and he served three terms as president of the Pennsylvania Folklore Society. He received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1957 to work on Black Rock, and garnered more national recognition for his folklore work with induction in 1960 into the American Folklore Society's honorary circle of Fellows. During the 1950s, Korson worked for the UMWA and the Red Cross in Washington, D.C. and travelled to Pennsylvania to add to his field collections in song and story. In 1965 he donated his collection of papers and recordings to the D. Leonard Corgan Library at King's College in Wilkes-Barre. In 2004, the American Folklife Center of the Library of Congress announced the transfer of the collection to the Library. Korson's often strenuous field trips into the coal region were undertaken despite his battles with heart disease for much of his later life; he finally succumbed after his seventh heart attack on May 23, 1967."}], "judgments": [{"rater": "16169597761094238409", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "11658533362118524115", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "16651790297630307764", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "11595942516201422884", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "2050861176556883424", "judgment": "no"}]}

A native of Birmingham, Alabama, Adams credits his grandfather, a former professional jazz clarinetist and accomplished pianist, as being his earliest musical inspiration. Adams began playing piano at the age of 6 and continued studying piano throughout high school and college. He worked with composer Michael Kapsner while studying abroad in Freiburg, Germany. While focusing on piano, organ, and music composition, his experience in Germany inspired Adams to continue his musical studies stateside. Adams graduated with a Bachelor's of Arts degree in Music from the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee. He continued his studies at the University of Alabama's School of Music in Tuscaloosa where he earned a Master's degree in Music Composition. Adams was drawn to Los Angeles in the mid ''90s to study film scoring at USC Thornton School of Music's famed Scoring for Motion Pictures and Television (SMPTV) program which is the world's most acclaimed programs of its kind. Adams worked as a freelance score composer for film and television until forming eastmountainsouth in 2001. After releasing a limited edition solo ep in 2005, Adams was praised by some critics, including The Boston Globe, who called it ``a beautiful set of Americana music...It confirms the dreamy-voiced Adams as an artist to follow.'' This effort was followed up by his first full-length solo release ''Gather Up`` in 2006. Virtually all of this album was recorded in his apartment in 2005 between touring dates. Southern California's super sessionman Greg Leisz on his famous Weisenborn guitar is featured on ''Queen of Hearts. `` Based on the response from this release, Peter was named ``Notable New Artist of the Year'' in 2006 by The Loft (Sirius XM) Satellite Radio.'' Before recording his next collection of music, Adams headed east to Nashville to be closer to musicians and producers with whom he wanted to work. While working on ''Gather Up`` Adams formed a collaborative bond with well-known session player and producer Lex Price. Now based out of Brooklyn, NY (via Nashville, Alabama, and Los Angeles) Adams is anything but a ``Nashville artist.'' Adams is currently signed to Sarathan Records (based in Seattle, Washington) which released his sophomore solo release, ``Leavetaking.'' This title was inspired by Mark Strand's poem ``The View.`` Peter Bradley Adams' most recent hit songs are ''Los Angeles`` and ''The Longer I Run.``"}], "judgments": [{"rater": "11595942516201422884", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "16169597761094238409", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "17082466750572480596", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "2050861176556883424", "judgment": "yes"}, {"rater": "16651790297630307764", "judgment": "yes"}]}

He arrived in Korea in 1887 as a Methodist minister; while there, he not only made major contributions to the spread of Christianity in Korea, but also founded three academic journals: The Korean Repository, The Korean Review, and Shinhak Wolbo (Theology Monthly). He also played a significant role in encouraging Korean migration to Hawaii; of the first ship of Korean migrant laborers bound for Hawaii to work on sugar plantations there, which departed on 22 December 1902, more than half came from his church in Incheon. In July 1907, he was the subject of a murder attempt; Yale University professor George Trumbull Ladd attributed the attack to opinions Jones had expressed in an article he wrote about the suppression of a Korean riot, in which he praised the Japanese police. In general, Jones had a high opinion of Koreans but not of Korean culture; in particular, he wrote high praise for Korean migrants in Hawaii, attributing their success in their adopted land to their liberation from ``the oppressive weight of past tradition, language, and association''.

Legend says he rejected the vedic philosophical debates of his upbringing to focus on Bhakti, especially on doing simple tasks for God. He would make garlands of flowers for the deity of the temple. One day the Pandyan king of the land had a competition between scholars to find one who would explain philosophical principles. Vishnuchittar won the competition by explaining that the path to moksha is by service to God. Legend goes that the king honored Vishnuchittar and God himself came down to earth to see this. Vishnuchittar composed a couplet called ``pallandu''(\u0baa\u0bb2\u0bcd\u0bb2\u0bbe\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bc1) (also called Thirup-Palandu(\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bb2\u0bcd\u0bb2\u0bbe\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bc1) out of respect) translating to ``Long live for many years, Long live for many years for Hundreds of thousands of years!'' to God. This is a very important prayer in Srivaishnava liturgy today. Vishnuchittar composed some pasurams in the 4000 Divya Prabhandham called Perialvar Tirumozhi where he explores a devotee's love for God through the metaphor of Yashoda's motherly love for Krishna.

For example, John was Mary Berkeley's third child, not her first, and history does not record her and the king being in the same location during this period. Naunton even claimed that Sir Owen Hopton, Lieutenant of the Tower of London, overheard Sir John say, 'Will the Queen suffer her brother to be offered up a sacrifice to the envy of his frisking adversaries?

His first instrument was the violin, which he studied at age 10. While attending school in Ho\u0159ice he was classmates with Jan Kubel\u00edk, with whom he maintained correspondence. He spent time performing both the violin and the cornet for a circus band in Prague. He also performed as an aerialist acrobat with the Rentz Circus in Germany, but an accident in 1886 ended this line of work. His father was a sculptor, and Bohumir also studied this art. He emigrated to the United States in 1889, paying the fare in part by performing with the ship's orchestra. Moving to Chicago, English sculptor H.R. Saunders furthered his profession in that area. Bohumir followed Saunders to Indianapolis and was soon employed, along with his brother, as a sculptor by General Lew Wallace and also working on the Soldiers`` and Sailor's Monument. During this time he joined the When Clothing Company Band, playing the cornet and soloing on this instrument. Before long he was hired by John Philip Sousa, but left in 1898 to join Thomas Preston Brooke's Chicago Marine Band, where he spent the next two years. During this time he studied with Weldon of Chicago's Second Regiment Band. In 1901 he spent some time with Phinney's United States Band, but he joined the Duss Band permanently that year. This group was based at Madison Square Garden, at $800 per-month and became its assistant conductor in 1903. This band, led by Frederick Innes, was not as well known, but he was hired as soloist, and the heavy touring schedule and two solos per concert gained him wide exposure. His solos would result in requests for multiple encores. Studying bandleaders Creatore and Vessela, he adopted a wild 'lionesque' hairstyle that became his trademark. He became acquainted with Joseph Jiran, who owned a Czechoslovakian music store in Chicago. With Jiran's encouragement, he formed his own band in 1906 styled as Kryl's Bohemian Band by 1910 with the Cimera brothers. This group worked for Columbia, Victor, and Zonophone, recording works by such composers as Smetana, Dvorak, and Safranek. He earned the distinction of the first Czech musician to record on phonograph cylinders. World War I interrupted his professional career, as he was serving in the U.S. Military. Here he attained the rank of Lieutenant and was given the title ``Bandmaster of all the Military Camp Bands in the country``. Immediately after the war he was touring with his bands, including many appearances on the Chautauqua circuit. This activity continued until he dismantled the band in 1931. From 1926 to 1929 he would spend winters at his mansion in Tarpon Springs, Florida. He built a bandshell on his property and would give numerous concerts each year. Through his compositions and band touring, he became a millionaire by the mid 1920s. The Great Depression did not affect his personal affluence as much as others, as he was a bank president and a known financier in 1932. He later formed a ``Women's Symphony Orchestra'' that featured daughter Josephine on violin and daughter Marie on piano. He also formed and conducted the ''Kryl Symphony Orchestra``, which featured soloists such as Florian ZaBach and vocalist Mary McCormic. His public musical career ended in the late 1940s, when he had difficulties with the American Federation of Musicians, because although his musicians were well taken care of, he did not pay scale. His last groups played popular dance music as well as ''heavier classics``. Before his musical retirement, he had traveled more than one million miles and soloed more than 12,000 times. His touring included many small towns such as Albany, Oregon and Bend, Oregon, where his orchestra was the first appearance by any symphony orchestra there. Aside from the United States, he toured Canada, Cuba, and Mexico with his bands and orchestras and America and Europe with his daughters. He later formed booking agency and a music bureau. An Honorary Doctor of Letters was given to him in 1957. He died at his summer home in Wilmington, New York, on August 7, 1961, leaving an estate valued at over 1 million dollars. His widow was Mary Jerabek Kryl."}], "judgments": [{"rater": "17082466750572480596", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "16169597761094238409", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "2050861176556883424", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "5505751039176460562", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "11595942516201422884", "judgment": "no"}]}

He received no education except some desultory instruction at a school held in the Wesleyan chapel, which he supplemented by private study. About 1850 he obtained a situation as store-boy at the locomotive works of the London and North-Western railway at Longsight. Two years later he was bound apprentice as a fitter and turner at the same works. Encouraged by the locomotive superintendent, Mr. Ramsbottom, he applied himself especially to Latin, Greek, and the natural sciences, and when seventeen began to attend the evening classes at the Manchester Mechanics' Institution. A year later he became lay preacher for the Wesleyans, but on account of his scientific opinions he had to abandon his notion of becoming a minister. After a brief stay in the engineer draughtsman's office at the Crewe works, he obtained in 1863 a position as sub-editor on the Norwich Mercury under Richard Noverra Bacon. Subsequently he became editor of the Norwich People's Journal, an offshoot of the Mercury, and under him the Journal speedily became a success. His leisure was devoted to scientific study, and from 1858 onwards he was a popular lecturer on science. In conjunction with John Gunn he established the Norwich Geological Society in 1864, and founded the Science Gossip Club (Norwich) in 1870. He was elected a fellow of the Geological Society in 1869, and a fellow of the Linnean Society in June 1873. In 1872 he was appointed by the corporation of Ipswich curator of the museum in that town. The duties of this post included the delivery of lectures. He also lectured in many parts of the country, and went on a lecturing tour in Australia during 1885. Through failing health he was compelled to resign his post in 1893. He died in Ipswich on 28 Sept. 1895. He married on 31 Jan. 1866 Sarah Harriet, youngest daughter of William Bellamy, headmaster of the boys' model school, Norwich."}], "judgments": [{"rater": "16651790297630307764", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "16169597761094238409", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "11595942516201422884", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "1014448455121957356", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "5505751039176460562", "judgment": "no"}]}

His latest collection of poems is Clinging to the Myth (2007) in which he refelects on grief and personal bereavement and uses the voices of 18th century Gaelic poetry to respond to the challenges of a post-Christian Ireland.

In 1958 he began earning his living as a professional author, and from 1976 on he was permanently employed by Norddeutscher Rundfunk Hamburg as a director of radio plays. His short stories and novels very often deal with ``losers'' -- as a very young man, he himself became handicapped while at war. His work shows Paul P\u00f6rtner to be a writer who was deeply drawn to the burlesque as well as having his characters act in desperate ways. He loved experimental language and word play. His interest in avant-garde theatre led him to the theories of Jacob Levy Moreno, Antonin Artaud and Erwin Piscator. However, through his work on stage as director and playwright he fell under the charm of the commedia dell'arte, Kurt Schwitters or Alfred Jarry. In 1963 Paul P\u00f6rtner invented the interactive play Scherenschnitt oder Der M\u00f6rder sind Sie where the audience takes over the leading role. It premiered the same year at the Ulmer Theatre, and thereafter, 75 German-speaking theatres followed. In the USA Scherenschnitt, entitled Shear Madness, became the longest running play ever done in American history. Eighteen productions in other countries have made Scherenschnitt a singular international hit: following Agatha Christie`s Mouse Trap, Paul P\u00f6rtner`s interactive play is the longest-running play around the world. In addition to 17 theatre plays, P\u00f6rtner wrote more than 20 radio plays that are still influential in this typically German genre."}], "judgments": [{"rater": "1014448455121957356", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "16169597761094238409", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "17082466750572480596", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "11595942516201422884", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "2050861176556883424", "judgment": "yes"}]}

He started to play guitar at twelve years old, and by seventeen, he was discovered by Norman Whitfield of Motown Records. Soon after, he became a regular session player for the famed studios. The first song he ever played on was ``Papa was a Rolling Stone'' by The Temptations. That year the album won five Grammy Awards. After playing on numerous albums, when Motown moved offices to California they paid for him to move so they could continue using his services as a session guitar player. He soon joined the group Rare Earth and is credited as being co-writer on three songs from the Back to Earth album. After quitting Motown as a studio player in 1975, Ray Manzarek of The Doors employed Paul to become lead guitarist for his new band Nite City. By their second album Paul had also become the lead singer and wrote a number of songs on the Album Golden Days Diamond Night. The band had separated by the release of their second album. Paul Warren by 1978 had formed his own band Paul Warren and Explorer - and was a regular on the Sunset Strip scene playing almost every weekend at either the Roxy, Whiskey a Go Go, the Starwood, and Madame Wongs in China Town - among many others. He was signed by RSO Records and released his first solo album One of the Kids in 1980. Later that year RSO Records folded and Paul Warren found himself unemployed. He began being a guitar player for hire between the years 1981 and 1987, working for such greats and The Ventures, Tina Turner and Prism. He is also credited as producing a number of records in this era. In 1987 he joined Richard Marx at the beginning of his career soon after the first release of his first song from his debut album. Paul was Richard Marx's Musical Director for seven years before quitting in 1994, as his career as an artist was coming to an end. The day after quitting Richard he went straight out on the road to work as lead guitarist for Joe Cocker. The ``Have a Little Faith Tour'' lasted eighteen months. In 1996 he was then employed by Italian singer Eros Ramazzotti. His guitar playing for Eros lasted eleven years before quitting for good in 2005. In the interim in 1999 he was employed in between tours with Eros to work as guitarist for Rod Stewart. He has now been playing for Stewart for eleven years. In late 2010 he is releasing his first solo album in over a decade to be entitled Round Trip with his band The Paul Warren Project"}], "judgments": [{"rater": "17082466750572480596", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "16169597761094238409", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "11658533362118524115", "judgment": "no"}, {"rater": "2050861176556883424", "judgment": "yes"}, {"rater": "1014448455121957356", "judgment": "no"}]}
